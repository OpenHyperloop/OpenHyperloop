**3. Background**

The  corridor  between  San  Francisco,  California  and  Los  Angeles,  California  is
one  of  the  most  often  traveled  corridors  in  the  American  West.  The  current
practical  modes  of  transport  for  passengers  between  these  two  major
population centers include:
 1.  Road (inexpensive, slow, usually not environmentally sound)
2.  Air (expensive, fast, not environmentally sound)
3.  Rail (expensive, slow, often environmentally sound)

A  new  mode  of  transport  is  needed  that  has  benefits  of  the  current  modes
without  the  negative  aspects  of  each.  This  new  high  speed  transportation
system has the following requirements:
 1.  Ready when the passenger is ready to travel (road)
2.  Inexpensive (road)
3.  Fast (air)
4.  Environmentally friendly (rail/road via electric cars)

The current contender for a new transportation system between southern and
northern  California  is  the  “California  High  Speed  Rail.”  The  parameters
outlining this system include:
 1.  Currently \$68.4 billion USD proposed cost
2.  Average  speed  of  164  mph  (264  kph)  between  San  Francisco  and  Los
 Angeles

3.  Travel  time  of  2  hours  and  38  minutes  between  San  Francisco  and  Los
 Angeles
 a.  Compare with 1 hour and 15 minutes by air
b.  Compare with 5 hours and 30 minutes by car****
 4.  Average one-way ticket price of
\$105 one-way [(reference)](http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2009/12/15/projected_ticket_price_goes_up_for_highspeed_rail_ridership_down.php)
 a.  Compare with \$158 round trip by air for September 2013
b.  Compare  with  \$115  round  trip  by  road  (\$4/gallon  with  30  mpg
 vehicle)

A  new  high  speed  mode  of  transport  is  desired  between  Los  Angeles  and  San
Francisco;  however,  the  proposed  California  High  Speed  Rail  does  not  reduce
current trip times or reduce costs relative to existing modes of transport. This
preliminary  design  study  proposes  a  new  mode  of  high  speed  transport  that
reduces  both  the  travel  time  and  travel  cost  between  Los  Angeles  and  San
Francisco.  Options  are  also  included  to  increase  the  transportation  system  to
other  major  population  centers  across  California.  It  is  also  worth  noting  the
energy cost of this system is less than any currently existing mode of transport

requirements of Hyperloop is the fully electric Tesla Model S.
