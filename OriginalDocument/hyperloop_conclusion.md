**6. Conclusions
**A high speed transportation system known as Hyperloop has been developed in
this  document.  The  work  has  detailed  two  version  of  the  Hyperloop:  a
passenger  only  version  and  a  passenger  plus  vehicle  version.  Hyperloop  could
transport people, vehicles, and freight between Los Angeles and San Francisco
in  35  minutes.  Transporting  7.4  million  people  each  way  and  amortizing  the
cost of \$6 billion over 20 years gives a ticket price of \$20 for a one-way trip for
the passenger version of Hyperloop.  The passenger plus vehicle version of the
Hyperloop is less than 9% of the cost of the proposed passenger only high speed
rail system between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

An  additional  passenger  plus  transport  version  of  the  Hyperloop  has  been
created  that  is  only  25%  higher  in  cost  than  the  passenger  only  version.  This
version  would  be  capable  of  transport  passengers,  vehicles,  freight,  etc.  The
passenger plus vehicle version of the Hyperloop is less than 11% of the cost of
the  proposed  passenger  only  high  speed  rail  system  between  Los  Angeles  and
San Francisco. Additional technological developments and further optimization
could likely reduce this price.

The  intent  of  this  document  has  been  to  create  a  new  open  source  form  of
transportation that could revolutionize travel. The authors welcome feedback

and will incorporate it into future revisions of the Hyperloop project, following
other open source models such as Linux.
