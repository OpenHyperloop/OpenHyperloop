**4.5. Safety and Reliability**

The  design  of  Hyperloop  has  been  considered  from  the  start  with  safety  in
mind.    Unlike  other  modes  of  transport,  Hyperloop  is  a  single  system  that
incorporates the vehicle, propulsion system, energy management, timing, and
route.    Capsules  travel  in  a  carefully  controlled  and  maintained  tube
environment.    The  system  is  immune  to  wind,  ice,  fog,  and  rain.    The
propulsion  system  is  integrated  into  the  tube  and  can  only  accelerate  the
capsule to speeds that are safe in each section.  With human control error and
unpredictable  weather  removed  from  the  system,  very  few  safety  concerns
remain.

Some of the safety scenarios below are unique to the proposed system, but all
should be considered relative to other forms of transportation.  In many cases
Hyperloop is intrinsically safer than airplanes, trains, or
automobiles.** **

**4.5.1. Onboard Passenger Emergency**

All capsules would have direct radio contact with station operators in case of
emergencies,  allowing  passengers  to  report  any  incident,  to  request  help  and

* * * * *

to  receive  assistance.  In  addition,  all  capsules  would  be  fitted  with  first  aid
equipment.

The Hyperloop allows people to travel from San Francisco to LA in 30 minutes.
Therefore in case of emergency,
it is likely that the best course of action would
be for the capsule to communicate the situation to the station operator and for
the  capsule  to  finish  the  journey  in  a  few  minutes  where  emergency  services
would be waiting to assist.

Typical  times  between  an  emergency  and  access  to  a  physician  should  be
shorter than if an incident happened during airplane takeoff.
In the case of the
airplane, the route would need to be adjusted, other planes rerouted, runways
cleared, airplane landed, taxi to a gate, and doors opened.  An emergency in a
Hyperloop capsule simply requires the system to complete the planned journey
and meet emergency personnel at the destination.

**4.5.2. Power Outage**

The vast majority of the Hyperloop travel distance is spent coasting and so the
capsule does not require continuous power to travel. The capsule life support
systems  will  be  powered  by  two  or  more  redundant  lithium  ion  battery  pack
and so would be unaffected by a power outage. In the event of a power outage
occurring after a capsule had been launched, all linear accelerators would be
equipped  with  enough  energy  storage  to  bring  all  capsules  currently  in  the
Hyperloop  tube  safely  to  a  stop  at  their  destination.  In  addition,  linear
accelerators  using  the  same  storage  would  complete  the  acceleration  of  all
capsules  currently  in  the  tube.  For  additional  redundancy,  all  Hyperloop
capsules  would  be  fitted  with  a  mechanical  braking  system  to  bring  capsules
safely to a stop.

In summary, all journeys would be completed as expected from the passenger’s
perspective.    Normal  travel  schedules  would  be  resumed  after  power  was
restored.

**4.5.2. Capsule Depressurization**

Hyperloop  capsules  will  be  designed  to  the  highest  safety  standards  and
manufactured  with  extensive  quality  checks  to  ensure  their  integrity.  In  the
event  of  a  minor  leak,  the  onboard  environmental  control  system  would
maintain  capsule  pressure  using  the  reserve  air  carried  onboard  for  the  short
period  of  time  it  will  take  to  reach  the  destination.  In  the  case  of  a  more
significant depressurization,  oxygen  masks  would  be  deployed as  in  airplanes.
Once  the  capsule  reached  the  destination  safely  it  would  be  removed  from
service.  Safety of the onboard air supply in Hyperloop would be very similar to
aircraft, and can take advantage of decades of development in similar
systems.

* * * * *

In the unlikely event of a large scale capsule depressurization, other capsules
in the tube would automatically begin emergency braking whilst the Hyperloop
tube would undergo rapid re-pressurization along its entire length.

**4.5.3. Capsule Stranded in Tube**

A  capsule  becoming  stranded  in  the  Hyperloop  tube  is  highly  unlikely  as  the
capsule  coasts  the  majority  of  the  distance  at  high  speed  and  so  there  is  no
propulsion required for more than 90% of the journey.

If  a  capsule  were  somehow  to  become  stranded,  capsules  ahead  would
continue  their  journeys  to  the  destination  unaffected.  Capsules  behind  the
stranded  one  would  be  automatically  instructed  to  deploy  their  emergency
mechanical braking systems. Once all capsules behind the stranded capsule had
been  safely  brought  to  rest,  capsules  would  drive  themselves  to  safety  using
small onboard electric motors to power deployed wheels.

All  capsules  would  be  equipped  with  a  reserve  air  supply  great  enough  to
ensure the safety of all passengers for a worst case scenario event.

**4.5.4. Structural Integrity of the Tube in Jeopardy**

A minor depressurization of the tube is unlikely to affect Hyperloop capsules or
passengers  and  would  likely  be  overcome  by  increased  vacuum  pump  power.
Any minor tube leaks could then be repaired during
standard maintenance.

In  the  event  of  a  large  scale  leak,  pressure  sensors  located  along  the  tube
would automatically communicate with all capsules to deploy their emergency
mechanical braking systems.

**4.5.5. Earthquakes**

California is no stranger to earthquakes and transport systems and all built with
earthquakes  in  mind.  Hyperloop  would  be  no  different  with  the  entire  tube
length built with the necessary flexibility to withstand the earthquake motions
while maintaining the Hyperloop tube alignment.

It  is  also  likely  that  in  the  event  of  a  severe  earthquake,  Hyperloop  capsules
would be commanded remotely to actuate their mechanical emergency braking
systems.

**4.5.6. Human Related Incidents**

Hyperloop  would  feature  the  same  high  level  of  security  used  at  airports.
However,  the  regular  departure  of  Hyperloop  capsules  would  result  in  a
steadier and faster flow of passengers through security screening compared to

* * * * *

airports.  Tubes located on pylons would limit access to the critical elements of
the system.   Multiple redundant power sources and vacuum pumps would limit
the impact of any single element.

**4.5.7. Reliability
**The Hyperloop system comprising all infrastructure, mechanical,
electrical, and
software components will be designed so that it is reliable, durable, and fault
tolerant  over  its  service  life  (100  years),  while  maintaining  safety  levels  that
match or exceed the safety standard of
commercial air transportation.
