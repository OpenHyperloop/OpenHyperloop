**4. Hyperloop Transportation System**

Hyperloop [(Figure 2 ](hyperloop_alpha.html#10)throu[gh Figure 3) ](hyperloop_alpha.html#11)is a proposed transportation system for
traveling  between  Los  Angeles,  California, and  San  Francisco,  California  in  35
minutes. The Hyperloop consists of several distinct components,
including:
 1.  Capsule:

a.  Sealed capsules carrying 28 passengers each that travel along the
 interior of the tube depart  on average every 2 minutes from Los
Angeles  or  San  Francisco  (up  to  every  30  seconds  during  peak
usage hours).

b.  A larger system has also been sized that allows transport of 3 full
 size automobiles with passengers to travel in the capsule.

c.  The  capsules  are  separated  within the  tube  by  approximately  23
 miles (37 km) on average during operation.

d.  The  capsules  are  supported  via  air  bearings  that  operate  using a
 compressed air reservoir and aerodynamic lift.
 2.  Tube:

a.  The tube is made of steel. Two tubes will be welded together in a

side  by  side  configuration  to  allow  the  capsules  to  travel  both
directions.
 b.  Pylons are placed every 100 ft (30 m) to support the tube.
c.  Solar  arrays  will  cover  the  top  of  the  tubes  in  order  to  provide
 power to the system.
 3.  Propulsion:
 a.  Linear accelerators are constructed along the length of the tube
 at various locations to accelerate the capsules.
 b.  Stators are located on the capsules to transfer momentum to the
 capsules via the linear accelerators.
 4.  Route:

a.  There will be a station at Los Angeles and San Francisco. Several
 stations along the way will be possible with splits in the tube.

b.  The  majority  of  the  route  will  follow  I-5  and  the  tube  will  be
 constructed in the median.

In  addition  to  these  aspects  of  the  Hyperloop,  safety  and  cost  will  also  be
addressed in this study.

The Hyperloop is sized to allow expansion as the network becomes increasingly
popular.  The  capacity  would  be  840  passengers  per  hour  which  more  than
sufficient  to  transport  all  of  the  6  million  passengers  traveling  between  Los
Angeles and San Francisco areas per year. In addition, this accounts for 70% of
those  travelers  to  use  the  Hyperloop  during  rush  hour.  The  lower  cost  of
traveling  on  Hyperloop  is  likely  to  result  in  increased  demand,  in  which  case
the time between capsule departures could be significantly shortened.
