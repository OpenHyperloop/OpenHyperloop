**7. Future Work**

Hyperloop  is  considered  an  open  source  transportation  concept.  The  authors
encourage all members of
the community to contribute to the Hyperloop design
process. Iteration of the design by various individuals and groups can help bring
Hyperloop from an idea to a reality.

The authors recognize the need for additional work, including but not limited
to:

1.  More  expansion  on  the  control  mechanism  for  Hyperloop  capsules,
 including attitude thruster or control moment gyros.

2.  Detailed  station  designs  with  loading  and  unloading  of  both  passenger
 and passenger plus vehicle versions of the Hyperloop capsules.

3.  Trades  comparing  the  costs  and  benefits  of  Hyperloop  with  more
 conventional magnetic levitation systems.

4.  Sub-scale  testing  based  on  a  further  optimized  design  to  demonstrate
 the physics of Hyperloop.

Feedback is welcomed on these or any useful aspects of the Hyperloop design.
